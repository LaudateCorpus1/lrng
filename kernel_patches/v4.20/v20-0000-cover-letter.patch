Subject: [PATCH v20 0/5]
Hi,

The following patch set provides a different approach to /dev/random which
I call Linux Random Number Generator (LRNG) to collect entropy within the Linux
kernel. The main improvements compared to the legacy /dev/random is to provide
sufficient entropy during boot time as well as in virtual environments and when
using SSDs. A secondary design goal is to limit the impact of the entropy
collection on massive parallel systems and also allow the use accelerated
cryptographic primitives. Also, all steps of the entropic data processing are
testable.

The design and implementation is driven by a set of goals described in [1]
that the LRNG completely implements. Furthermore, [1] includes a
comparison with RNG design suggestions such as SP800-90B, SP800-90C, and
AIS20/31.

The LRNG provides a complete separation of the noise source maintenance
and the collection of entropy into an entropy pool from the post-processing
using a pseudo-random number generator. Different PRNGs are supported,
including:

* Built-in ChaCha20 PRNG which has no dependency to other kernel
  frameworks.

* SP800-90A DRBG using the kernel crypto API including its accelerated
  raw cipher implementations.

* Arbitrary PRNGs registered with the kernel crypto API

Booting the patch with the kernel command line option
"dyndbg=file drivers/char/lrng* +p" generates logs indicating the operation
of the LRNG. Each log is pre-pended with "lrng:".

The LRNG has a flexible design by allowing an easy replacement of the
deterministic random number generator component.

Changes (compared to the previous patch set for 4.18):

 * Enable compile on 4.20
 * Small locking update leading to small performance improvements

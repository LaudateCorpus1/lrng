# To perform testing, you must generate HID events.
#
# Execute on a quiet test system:
#
#	1. stap -g -v -w <THISFILE>
#
#	2. move your mouse or type on your keyboard
#
# Analyze: convert output into binary and then run your favorite analyzer
#
# To convert it into one bit as performed by the LRNG, use timetobit.c.

# The output of this test writes one delta value per line.

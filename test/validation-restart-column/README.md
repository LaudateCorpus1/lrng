# Validation of Raw Entropy Data Restart Test

This validation tool processes the restart raw entropy data compliant to
SP800-90B section 3.1.4 column-wise.

Each restart must be recorded in a single file where each raw entropy
value is stored on one line.

## Prerequisites

To execute the testing, you need:

	* NIST SP800-90B tool from:
		https://github.com/usnistgov/SP800-90B_EntropyAssessment

	* Obtain the sample data recorded on the target platforms

	* Configure processdata.sh with proper parameter values
